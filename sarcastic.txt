You said you'd stay committed 2 the relationship if everything is good but the sex was horrible with no chance of getting better! #YeahRight #sarcasm
You seem pretty scared of catching the flu for someone who's not remotely scared of catching STDs. #sarcasm
You should just fall in love with me already. So I can immediately lose interest and we can both move on with our lives. #sarcasm

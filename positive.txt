@realbencarson, a proven track record of making USA great, all you've done @realdonaldjtrump is " crippled America "
@realDonaldTrump @ABC2020 @ABC @BarbaraJWalters Great interview. Trump is a family man and wants to put America back on track - He will too.
@realDonaldTrump All that money you saved by not paying taxes... use it to fund yourself.
@realDonaldTrump ALWAYS makes me wonder why the Party of 'personal responsibility ' can NEVER take responsibility for ANYTHING they do.
@realDonaldTrump America was built on hope and oppurtunity that's what you give us the American people thank you Donald Trump! TRUMP 2016
@realDonaldTrump... a river branch from Mississippi to Colorado river to end drought in the South West? Nothing is impossible. W. love.
@realDonaldTrump before you can ever say that you are the best candidate to be president take a look at your flaws first and make it better
@realDonaldTrump better talk to your Dr. He is not doing you any good this afternoon.
@realDonaldTrump boasts about his philanthropy. But his giving falls short of his words. - The Washington Post https://t.co/u2qWXGJo6o
@realDonaldTrump @CNN So basically, you dont know whom is documeting you.. Ok, how about deciding on a moderator so we can have a debate
@realDonaldTrump Dear Donald, You would be a great President if you used your God given gifts correctly. FIRST Show UNCONDITIONAL LOVE????
@realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr You gotta use Mr Vaughn's story more. He is a real inspiration to Americans.
@realDonaldTrump do not alter your first thought on the 2nd Am. You aren't wrong.
@realDonaldTrump for a 70 year old you can stay up late lmao. My grandparents go to bed at like 8pm

@realDonaldTrump @GOP Wht part of th LAW R U missing?! ONLY LEGAL CITIZENS R allowed 2 VOTE in USA Elections! Thts Y Voter ID mandatory #DNC
@realDonaldTrump has more twitter followers than number of people who watched #Emmys
@realDonaldTrump Hi Donald. I'm a big Redskins football fan. I respect American Indians. Do you have any policies protecting their heritage?
@realDonaldTrump how can I vote for a man who knows nothing about black ppl in America. I will never vote for a man like you.
@realDonaldTrump I DON'T TO DO THAT JUST BE OBSERVATION FOR THAT SIR, UH IT'S THAT THE TRUE FOR THAT YOU SEE THAT.
@realDonaldTrump I dunno. They seem to do really well just quoting one of your stump speeches and running with that.
@realDonaldTrump If that means you promise to move to the UK forever and never come back, I promise to vote for you. @LouiseMensch
@realDonaldTrump If the Blacks & Latino's think the Dems have their interest at heart they had better wake up. All they want is your vote
@realDonaldTrump if u win you know someone gonna assinate u right.
@realDonaldTrump If you are elected President wait WHEN you are elected President will it be easier to get a job for US legal citizens?
@realDonaldTrump I have a solution, its not a wall.. just need to hear my idea... I can help you win.. Good luck.. You got this #Dontfirejushire
@realDonaldTrump i love how non-pc you are. thanks for keeping it real
@realDonaldTrump I'm sure you will not have 15 % of their vote.
@RealDonaldTrump @ImWithHer Your daily reminder that you are rich white trash, and your supporters are trash too.
@realDonaldTrump is a great man, gave a great speech and will make a GREAT president.
@realDonaldTrump is a super amalgamation of every Florida Man ever to exist.
@realDonaldTrump I saw pics. My buddy was there. He looks like a shark tore him in half so they VIPed him entrance to get out of the heat.
@realDonaldTrump isn't. He believes he should get special treatment compared to everyone else @lovinabox
@realDonaldTrump IT will be easier for a hump - back camel to go through the eye of a needle, then you and your kind
@realDonaldTrump Let me be perfectly clear this year the polls are not accurate - I RECEIVE 10+ POLL CALLS A DAY & WILL NOT RESPOND TO ANY
@realDonaldTrump Let's hope so, she has some under a spell
@realDonaldTrump listen to @MonicaCrowley. She gave a great resp on @FoxNews to counter the 50 Traitors who signed the open letter. Use this
@realDonaldTrump more like flush the toilet it's time for brexit baby
@realDonaldTrump My friend says you have gigantic fucking daddy issues, care to comment?
@realDonaldTrump Never in a trillion years will you win never in a trillion years will you be our president.
@realDonaldTrump #NeverTrump Except they were Republican Bush's friends and it was Saudis on those planes.
@realDonaldTrump nope you started racist conversations talking about President Obama right out the gate
@realDonaldTrump Not as big as your Hackergate U know NSA knows thanks to the Blackweb U R involved, they said leaks coming out at debate
@realDonaldTrump not employed but my wife and I would love a couple of hats or a yard sign or bumper sticker
@realDonaldTrump OK you want records released. How about those tax returns. I think you owe the American people some answers.
@realDonaldTrump @oreillyfactor @FoxNews Yes. People enjoy watching you put your big fat foot in your mouth every time you speak!
@realDonaldTrump pence doesn't seem to anyways agree with your so called plans. Has his own... maybe he wants to be President.
@realDonaldTrump probably because he is another rich man, when are the white working class learned that they were dissed @ChuckGrassley
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @GovMikeHuckabee Prominent republicans are openly withdrawing their support to you ; how do you cope with that?
@realDonaldTrump She can give a good coherent speech, unlike yours. It's just that you only listen when its about you.
@realdonaldtrump smiling and waving at the 9-11 Memorial as if it were a campaign rally - HE IS A #GHOUL
@realDonaldTrump So glad that you continue to out the atrocities that call themselves " the media ". There day will come
@realDonaldTrump sure thing right after you release your taxes like Hillary and every candidate has done since Nixon, what r u afraid of?
@realDonaldTrump surprised the Clinton camp of CNN did not blame you for it #trump #Clinton #cnn
@realDonaldTrump thank you for being the first person to tell the truth about the bombing yesterday. Vote Trump!
@realDonaldTrump Thank you for stepping up for the American people. We need a true leader like you in these tuff times.
@realDonaldTrump The Crooked "H" Wants too much control over the people like all dems.
@realDonaldTrump they say you've made the pivot, but I agree with you... it'll never happen. You're now just reading Kellyanne's words.
@realDonaldTrump trashing the Media, when the Media built him up! The issue is that a monster was created! @TeamHillaryC #TheLittleMan

@realDonaldTrump yes we are. So many people at the rally. Amazing
@realDonaldTrump Yes you are. I canceled our local newspaper, called and told them why.
@realDonaldTrump You are the only presidential candidate I've been eager to vote for and to see in office.
@realDonaldTrump you keep sticking your foot in your mouth. Let's be honest here.
@realDonaldTrump You must explain how you are going to deal with the Rio Grande River which is a shared U. S. border with Mexico! Forgot it?
@realDonaldTrump you need to read Matthew 12:25-26. a house divide against it self can not stand. you need the republican to win.
@realDonaldTrump you're a joke and a big dummy. A lot of people are saying that.
@realDonaldTrump your going to get your tail beat America is great
@realDonaldTrump Your strategy to include minorities is great. Please make it genuine by taking it to inner cities and churches.
@realDonaldTrump You should remove your cap when you address a crowd. It shades your eyes ; revealing your eyes communicates honesty.
@realDonaldTrump you wanna make America great how about helping out homeless vets
@realDonaldTrump you will never fix this system and you just want to votes to win the election
@realDonaldTrump You will never identify with minorities. You spent a year being disrespectful and NOW you want our votes @ crunch time!
